# Assembler: Assembly to Binary Translator

This repository contains a Java-based assembler that translates assembly language code into binary machine code. It is a simple yet efficient tool for understanding how assembly instructions are translated into machine-readable format.

## Features

- **Assembly to Binary Translation**: Converts assembly language instructions into binary representations.
- **Written in Java**: Easy to compile and run using Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Requirements

Before you can run this assembler, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You need to have the JDK installed to compile and run the Java program. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `apt` on Linux or `brew` on macOS.

## How to Compile and Run

To use the assembler, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine:
