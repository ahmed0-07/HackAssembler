# Assembler: Assembly to Binary Translator

This repository contains a Java-based assembler that translates assembly language code into binary machine code. It is a simple yet efficient tool for understanding how assembly instructions are translated into machine-readable format.

## Features

- **Assembly to Binary Translation**: Converts assembly language instructions into binary representations.
- **Written in Java**: Easy to compile and run using Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Requirements

Before you can run this assembler, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You need to have the JDK installed to compile and run the Java program. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `apt` on Linux or `brew` on macOS.

## How to Compile and Run

To use the assembler, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmed0-07/HackAssembler.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd HackAssembler
```

### 3. **Compile the Java Program**

To compile the Java source file, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

### 4. **Run the Assembler**

To run the assembler, use the java command followed by the path to the assembly file you want to translate. For example:

```bash
java Main path/to/your/assemblyfile.txt
```
### AND WAIT FOR THE TRANSLATED FILE.HACK
